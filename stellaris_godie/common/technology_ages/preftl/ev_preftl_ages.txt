### Technology ages for pre-FTL tech progression
# All ages must be reachable thru "next_age" entries from the first age entry, for the UI code to be able to determine which "age number" it is.

# <age_key> = {
#	# Optional. Which age the PreFTL will reach after this one. If none specified, the PreFTL will turn into a "real" country after this age.
# 	next_age = <other_age_key>
# }

ev_nuked_age = {
	next_age = industrial_age
