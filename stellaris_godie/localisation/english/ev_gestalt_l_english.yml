If you encounter any, please Proposed\nStreamline operations:\nRemove the consumption/output of secondary products and rare resources, you only need to control the energy/mineral/food expenditure.\nA new approach: The Taixu Swarm is not very dependent on the output of the Home Ship , Please use the decree to generate the initial home ship when appropriate.\nBiological Fleet:\nOnly food is needed to build the fleet. The price of the fleet is only controlled by technology.\nAmplification/Enhancement Technology:\nProduction of Taixu Swarm It is mainly obtained through technology. Two types of technology have been added, namely Amplification Technology and Enhanced Technology. The effect and consumption of Amplification Technology are 10 times that of Enhanced Technology.\nFleet price:\nPhysics/Engineering technology will increase fleet construction On the contrary, social technology will reduce the price of the fleet.\nLeader’s debut:\nLeader can provide output. After completing the corresponding technology, you can increase the value of output\nOre Law:\nYou can use minerals Issue various special laws"
