 ev_crisis.411.desc:0 "After a large number of sample comparisons and repeated tests, our scientists have found some ways to weaken the §Y$leviathans_union$§! Fleet.\n\n The planets that have not yet been polluted put a large number of experimental nutrient blocking microorganisms, which theoretically should prevent them from obtaining new nutrients through various forms, thereby blocking their pace. But at the same time, this kind of microorganisms will also greatly reduce the target planet. The second is to install some warheads and high-energy rays with deep penetrating effect into the fleet, which should greatly enhance the advantage of our fleet in combat.\n\nout For resource allocation considerations, we can only choose one option. Regardless, scientists hope to conduct an experimental attack to prove effective. What should we do?"

This information is called "identification code", and this simulation can even In the partial reconstruction of part of the reality, when one of our ships is controlled, this mimicry can infect the entire fleet at an extremely fast speed, thereby replacing and covering the entire fleet. It seems that our fleet is suddenly controlled. Or more like an “infection”.\n\nThe countermeasure is to block the information leaked by the destroyed ship. We can block §Y$leviathans_union$§!
